    "### Selection Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll develop our first sorting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a list `L` of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the largest element in the list `L`, and put it on the right of the list, at index `n-1`, by swapping it with whatever element happens to be currently at index `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the largest element of `L` is in the right place. Find the largest element in `L[:(n-1)]`, and swap it with the element current found at index `n-1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the largest element of `L` is in the right place, and the second-largest element is in the right place. Find the largest element in `L[:(n-2)]`, and swap it with the element current found at index `n-2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep on going until `L` is sorted. Note that at first, the entire `L` is unsorted. Then, `[L[n-1]]` is sorted, but `L[:n-1]` is unsorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `L[n-2:]` is the sorted part, and `L[:n-2]` is the unsorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we continue this way until `L` is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [3, 1, 2, 3, 6, 0]\n",
    "    #Swap the 6 with the 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    [3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 6]\n",
    "    #Swap the 3 with the 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    [3, 1, 2, 0, 3, 6]\n",
    "    #Swap the 3 with the 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 6]\n",
    "    #Swap the 2 with the 2 (2 is already in its correct place)\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 6]\n",
    "    #Swap the 1 with the 1 (1 is already in its correct place)\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 6]\n",
    "    #Swap the 0 with the 0 (0 is already in its correct place)\n",
    "                           (in fact, it's guaranteed to be, since it's\n",
    "                            the only element in the unsorted part of the list)\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 6]\n",
    "    \n",
