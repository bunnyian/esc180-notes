# IMPORTANT NOTES !!!
# 0. Adding new files
# If you add new files, you must add them to the toc manually
# First line of notebooks/md MUST be a header (eg. # Lecture 1) to be included

# 1. Changes to file/toc structure
# If major changes are made to the file structure, simply move the files around in the file system
# Export the file tree
# eg. 
# ├── L01
# │   ├── A Simple Python Program.ipynb
# │   ├── Introduction to Python Expressions and Variables.ipynb
# │   ├── conditionals.ipynb
# │   ├── header01.md
# │   └── tracing.mkv

# Then pass the file tree and part of this toc to Chat-GPT and it can regenerate the toc for you
# of course, check the output to make sure it's correct

# 2. HEADER files are used to change the title of the chapter
# they are currently only used as  "Lecture 1", "Lecture 2", etc.
# you can choose to give more descriptive lecture titles
# if you do so, you can reenable automatic numbering of lecture titles by setting 'numbered' to True
