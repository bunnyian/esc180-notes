# IMPORTANT NOTES !!!
# 0. Adding new files
# If you add new files, you must add them to the toc manually
# First line of notebooks/md MUST be a header (eg. # Lecture 1) to be included

# 1. Changes to file/toc structure
# You can move around pages in the toc below. Currently everything is organized in folders, but as long as 
# the filepaths are valid, the folders do not matter.

# 2. HEADER files are used to change the title of the chapter
# they are currently only used as  "Lecture 1", "Lecture 2", etc.
# you can choose to give more descriptive lecture titles
# if you do so, you can reenable automatic numbering of lecture titles by setting 'numbered' to True
