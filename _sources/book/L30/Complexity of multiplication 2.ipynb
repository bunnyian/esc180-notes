    "### Complexity of long multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, let's take a look at long multiplication. Suppose we are multiplying two numbers, each of which has $n$ digits.\n",

    "        246        \n",
    "       615\n",
    "       ======\n",
    "       64083 \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we multiply each digit with each other digit, for a total of $n^2$ multiplications of two digits together (multiplying two digits together is a constant-time operation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each product is then added onto a sum once (when computing the sum $64,083$). That means that in total, we perform approximately $n^2$ additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in total, we perform $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ operations. "
