    "Here is how we actually sort the 250 midterms for CSC180: we first separate them into piles by the first initial (i.e., the first letter of the last name.) We then sort each pile individiually. That's much faster: if we use, for example, Selection Sort, and we are able to separate the 250 midterms into 25 piles of 10, we'll be making $25\\times 10^2 /2 = 1250$ comparisons instead of $250^2/2 \\approx 30,000$ comparisons.\n",

    "We'll separate them into piles as follows: we'll have a pile of 1's, a pile of 2's, a pile of 3's, ..., a pile of 500's. We won't even need to then sort the piles, and will almost have the sorted list ready. Here's what the piles would look like:\n",

    "    pile of: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ..., 100, 101, ..., 500\n",
    "             *  *     *  *  *           *                 *              *\n",
    "             *  *        *\n",
    "             \n",
    "After we have the piles, we can read off the sorted list:\n",
    "            1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 10, 100, 500\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't literally need to maintain the piles: instead, we can keep track of how many 1's, 2's, 3's, ... etc. we've seen. Here is the algrithm. The algorithm is a special case of Bucket Sort, and is called Counting Sort."
