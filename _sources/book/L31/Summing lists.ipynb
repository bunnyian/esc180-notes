    "In `sum_list2`, we had to have two base cases. That's because of what happens when the length of the list is 1. We' would have computed `mid = 1//2 == 0`, which would mean that the first \"half\" of the list would be `L[:0]` (i.e., `[]`), and the second \"half\" of the list would be `L[0:]`, i.e., just a copy of `L`. That would result in infinite recursion if we didn't return right away when we see that the length of the list is `1`."
