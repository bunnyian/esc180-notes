# Welcome to the ESC180 Notes!

Welcome to EngSci! This is a sample book built automatically from a collection of Jupyter notebooks using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
