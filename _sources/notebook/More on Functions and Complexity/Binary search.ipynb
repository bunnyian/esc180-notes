    "Binary search is a search algorithm for finding elements in a *sorted list*. It works by dividing the list in half, then checking if the desired element `e` is greater or less than the middle element `mid`. Using this information, the algorithm can discard half of the list and repeat the process until the element is found.\n",

    "In the worst case scenario, `e` is not in the list. This means that binary search will divide the list until len(L) = 3. When len(L) == 1 then the while loop exits and the two final comparisons are done (constant time).\n",

    "low = 0\n",
    "high = len(L) - 1 = 0\n",
    "high-low = 0 # exit from the while loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the loop, there are 3 comparisons (1 for the while loop condition, and two for if statements) and outside of the loop there is a constant 2 final comparisons before a `return`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the complexity, we need to find the number of times the loop runs. In other words, we want to know how many times we can divide the list in half before we get to a list of length 1 (each time would correspond to 1 iteration).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find this by solving the following equation for $x$ (the number of times we can divide the list in half), where $n$ is the length of the list:\n",

    "\n",
    "$n = 2^x$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\log_2 n = x$\n",
