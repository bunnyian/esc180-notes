    "The reason `is_prime_bad()` returns `True` (even though $35 = 5\\times 7$, and so it isn't prime) is the `else` clause. We try every `i` between 2 and 34 (inclusive). When `i` is 2, `35 % i` isn't 0, so we get to the `return True` statement. Once that `return` statement is executed, the function returns, and  `is_prime_bad(35)`  is evaluated to `True`.\n",

    "That shouldn't happen: we should only return `True` after trying *all* the possible `i`'s. Just because 35 isn't even (i.e., isn't divisible by 2), it doesn't mean it's prime. That's why the correct thing to do is to return `True` *after* the loop ends.\n",
    "\n",
