    "This algorithm relied crucially on our being able to arrange \"buckets\" in such a way that we could put the elements of the list in them. Note that this would work much worse with, for example, strings. We *could* try to sort a list of names like that, but that would require setting up a *lot* of buckets, one for every possible name in the world.\n",

    "For sorting strings, we use something similar to what we have above, but the buckets are for the first initials, not for the entire strings. (That means that we'd have to process the buckets further than we did here.)\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios under which $max(L)$ is fixed:\n",
    "* The elements of `L` are known to be in some fixed range, for example 0..100\n",
    "* The elements of `L` are of a type that can only store numbers up to a certain magnitude. (The way `float`s in Python are, for example; although we couldn't sort `float`s using Counting Sort.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for example `max(L) = 100`, then $\\mathcal{O}(max(L)+len(L) = \\mathcal{O}(100+len(L)) = \\mathcal{O}(len(L))$ (100 is a constant that is dropped)."
